# Cryptoquib

Substitution cipher puzzle game.

## What is a Quib?

A quib is a short sentence or quote, likely a jest or witty comment.

## How Do I Play?

Using the method of trial and error, find the solution to the ciphered message. If you believe that A equals B, A will equal B throughout the cipher. To solve a substitution cipher, try some of the following tips:

-Look for single-letter words. (A or I in English)
-Apostrophes are generally followed by S, T, D, M, LL, or RE. (e.g. IT'S, WON'T, YOU'D, I'M, THEY'LL, THEY'RE, etc.)
-Look for two-letter words. (OF, TO, IN, IS, and IT are most frequently used)
-Look for three-letter words. (THE, AND, FOR, WAS, and HIS are most frequently used)
-Keep in mind letter frequency and count how many times a letter appears. (ETAOINSHRDLCUMWFGYPBVKJXQZ, Cornell University Math Explorer's Project)
-Look for repeating letter patterns, espescially near the beginning or end of words. (TH, SH, RE, CH, TR, ING, ION, ENT, etc.)
